# Generic rule 1) Generic detection of the file upload(scripts) vulnerability.
#                 Technically we should not see script write operation after the webapp is started.
#                 One corner case, say plugin installation after webapp is started.

# I would love to have this rule name like this but falco engine does not like this format. ;-)
